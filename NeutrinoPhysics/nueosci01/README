implementation of the exact numerical method por neutrino oscillations in varying matter density 
(T. Ohlsson et all Neutrino oscillations with three flavours in matter of varying density: 
Eur. Phys. J. C 20 507-515 2001)

added classes: NeutrinoOscInVarDensity

nueosci14: this is the base starting point for development (copy from code14)
objective: to make it into a production version for other people to use

AO: dec 2013

nueosci01: specific code (scripts/excecutables) used for paper 01
-> most of the important and generic code, such as NeutrinoOscInVarDensity has been moved to a library nueoscilib.
