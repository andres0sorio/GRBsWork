implementation of the exact numerical method por neutrino oscillations in varying matter density 
(T. Ohlsson et all Neutrino oscillations with three flavours in matter of varying density: 
Eur. Phys. J. C 20 507-515 2001)

added classes: NeutrinoOscInVarDensity

nueosci14: this is the base starting point for development (copy from code14)
objective: to make it into a production version for other people to use
